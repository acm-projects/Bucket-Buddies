# Bucket-Buddies

Have you ever had a bucket list of things to do with your friends but had trouble making those dreams a reality? If only you could keep track of all the ideas and make sure you're making time to make those memories. Oh wait -- you can, with Bucket Buddies!

## Tech Stack üíª

- Side note: React Native + MERN Stack is also an option; higher learning curve but also more appealing on participant resumes
  - Discuss with participants Week 1
  - Will switch out Flutter/Firebase resources for MERN stack resources if this decision is reached

- Front-End: Flutter
  - Widgets for UI design and easy integration with Firebase

- Back-End: Firebase
  - Real-time updates for the collaborative features like bucket list sharing and upvoting
  - User authentication
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications

## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions üëæ

- Learning curve to the technologies
  - With all of the tutorials and documentation available, we should be able to overcome this
  - Make sure participants are keeping up with learning how to use Flutter / Firebase / Git early on
- Large number of screens to implement for frontend
  - Start working on this early on and try to cut down to the minimum number possible to begin with for the MVP
- Lots of different data must be stored in database for backend (users, friends, bucket lists, created plans)
  - Start working on this early on so there is time to address any issues
  - Research best data structuring practices for these commonly implemented ideas such as friends

## Competition üìä

- Troupe
  - Exclusively focused on planning travel/trips with a group, not hangouts, dinners, and other things on a bucket list like Bucket Buddies
  - Includes trip pages, polls, voting, itinerary creation
- Howbout
  - Share calendars, find when everyone is free, chat
  - Not about creating a bucket list and making plans surrounding those ideas like Bucket Buddies is
- When2Meet
  - Share availability and find when everyone is free
  - Bucket Buddies will have many more features all inside of the app to help people make plans and do the things they‚Äôve wanted to do
